Use your keyboard to fly on IF!

If you run into any issues, please DM @Saharsh on the IFC.

Download Windows EXE from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y9D7noPvGynDlAhtK5pFFgkRG-KeLDo3/view?usp=sharing)

To run on mac, download [this](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1LMtD6M-zXc3pr5jsMfhEVkyrCYRauJFs?usp=sharing). When you are done downloading the file, make sure you install all the modules with pip. Open a terminal window and type in `sudo python3 ifconnect.py`, this should ask for your user password, don't worry, I don't store these passwords, this command runs it in admin. It will show a message that says `Connected on {IP} on port {PORT}`. Once you get this message, use your keyboard with the following commands below!
